    "Loops allow us to iterate over each element in a collection, like a list. Perhaps we could already do that by writing out a line of code for each element in the collection, but that wouldn't be very efficient, would it? No, not at all. With loops, we can write one line of code that operates on each element in a collection. Pretty cool, right? Let's get started!"

So, if all we want to do is print each element, then the line that prints the element is our block. Our block is indicated by indenting. So the first line after the colon `:` should be indented. When we want to end our block, we simply stop indenting. Any code follwing the for loop will only be executed after the for loop finishes.\n",

So, when we go through each item in a dictionary, we are actually working with a two-part element (with a key & value). Similarly to how we name a variable for the element in a list for a for loop, we name a variable for both the **key** and **value** when we iterate over a dictionary. However, in Python, we can't iterate directly over the dictionary, we iterate over the **items** of a dictionary, which are the key value pairs.  Let's take a look at an example."

    "In this lesson, we learned how to use loops to iterate through a collection of elements. We started with iterating through a list of numbers, and performed the same operation on each number. Then we saw how we can loop through the numbers and have each number be used to access a successive element from a separate list, like `countries`.  We then saw that to ensure that our list of numbers matched the indices of a our other list, we had to use the expression, `for element in list(range(0, len(list)))`. Finally, we introduced a naming convention that is commonly used when naming the variable for our loops when iterating over a collection that is a list of common elements (i.e. `ice_cream_flavor` for a list of `ice_cream_flavors`)."
